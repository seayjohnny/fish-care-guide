<h3>Water Problem Solving</h3>
<p>When complications occur in a freshwater aquarium, it's important to troubleshoot correctly and quickly. Identify the symptoms your fish, plants, or aquarium are exhibiting, and match them with the most likely problem to pinpoint an effective solution.</p><details>
    <summary>IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM</summary>
    <p>When you first notice an issue in your freshwater aquarium, one of the first and most helpful steps you should take is water testing. The API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT measures the key indicators of aquarium health: pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate. This highly accurate, economical, and easy-to-use kit performs over 800 tests, and includes precise color charts and information on how to correct unsafe water conditions. Any unsafe water conditions can stress the fish and may prevent fish from healing, so it is essential to correct any water problems before additional treatment.</p>

    <summary>CLEARING THE WATER</summary>
    <p>At times, aquarium water may become cloudy due to accumulation of waste, or as the natural aquarium cycle establishes itself in your tank (which can take a few weeks). Your quick solution is API® ACCU-CLEAR™ water clarifier, which rapidly clears hazy aquarium water by clumping small floating particles together to form larger particles that the aquarium filter then more easily removes. API ACCU-CLEAR water clarifier not only treats the symptoms of a cloudy aquarium, but removes the clumps and chemicals that cause the problem. Use as needed to maintain clear aquarium water.</p>

    <summary>CONTROLLING ALGAE</summary>
    <p>Algae growth is a common problem in most freshwater aquariums, but can be easily minimized and controlled with API® ALGAEFIX™ algae control. This liquid aquarium treatment reduces algae growth and effectively controls "green water" algal blooms, and String or Hair algae. ALGAEFIX algae control will not alter pH or discolor water, and is a safe algaecide for aquariums containing live plants and fish. ALGAEFIX algae control may be used weekly to reduce aquarium maintenance, and is an effective remedy for reducing unsightly algae in conjunction with keeping your tank out of direct sunlight and monitoring your aquarium lighting.</p>

    <summary>TREATING AMMONIA</summary>
    <p>Toxic ammonia is never safe for fish, even in small amounts. If test results show the presence of ammonia in your freshwater aquarium, act quickly: perform a partial water change, then neutralize ammonia with API® AMMO LOCK™ ammonia detoxifier.</p>

    <summary>RAISING AQUARIUM pH</summary>
    <p>In order for fish to thrive, the water needs to be kept at the same pH level that is best suited for their type and best mimics their natural habitat conditions. For instance, a pH of 6.8 – 7.2 is ideal for keeping an aquarium containing a variety of tropical fish, while a pH of 6.0 – 8.0 is best for goldfish.</p>

    <summary>FOR CLEAN, CLEAR WATER</summary>
    <p>Fish release organic materials into an aquarium through their waste. Algae and uneaten fish food also result in aquarium pollution, and can degrade water quality if left untreated. API® BIO-CHEM ZORB™ filtration media contains the highest grade resin/carbon blend available on the market today for the superior removal of aquarium pollutants, including colors and odors, and it removes light-blocking impurities for improved growth of plants in freshwater aquariums. This breakthrough water filtration technology is more effective than carbon alone, and is available in ready-to-use pouches or cartridges to fit most filters.</p>

    <summary>REMOVING PHOSPHATE</summary>
    <p>Phosphate is released by fish waste, decaying organic matter, and tap water sources. API® PHOS-ZORB™ filtration media is a special filtration media that selectively removes phosphate and silicate, which can cloud aquarium water or contribute to algae growth, keeping your aquarium clean and clear. API PHOS-ZORB filtration media does not remove trace elements or affect pH, and is safe for all fish and plants. Available in a ready-to-use pouches to fit most filters.</p>

    <summary>REMOVING TOXIC COMPOUNDS</summary>
    <p>When starting a new freshwater aquarium, toxic ammonia and nitrite commonly spike as the nitrogen cycle begins to develop. API® NITRA-ZORB™ filtration media is a special filtration media that removes ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate from aquarium water, restoring safe aquatic conditions for fish, and may be used in both new and established aquariums whenever harmful chemicals are detected. API NITRA-ZORB filtration media may be recharged for extended use, and is available in ready-to-use pouches or cartridges to fit most filters.</p>
